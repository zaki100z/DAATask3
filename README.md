# Comprehensive Report: Optimization of City Transportation Network Using Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms

## Executive Summary

This report presents the implementation and analysis of two Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms—Prim's and Kruskal's—for optimizing a city transportation network. The project successfully demonstrates how these algorithms can determine the most cost-effective road construction plan while ensuring all city districts remain connected. Both algorithms were implemented in Java and tested on multiple graph scenarios, with detailed performance metrics collected for comparative analysis.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement
The city administration needs to construct roads connecting all districts such that:
- Each district is reachable from any other district
- The total construction cost is minimized
- The solution represents the most efficient transportation network

### 1.2 Graph Theory Application
This problem is modeled as a weighted undirected graph where:
- **Vertices** represent city districts
- **Edges** represent potential roads
- **Edge weights** represent construction costs

### 1.3 Algorithms Implemented
- **Prim's Algorithm**: Greedy algorithm that grows the MST from an arbitrary starting vertex
- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Greedy algorithm that builds the MST by sorting and adding edges
